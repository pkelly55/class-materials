## CMPSC 202 Spring 2023: Midterm Exam Preparatory Sheet

Date/Time: Friday, 03/03/2023 [during lab time]

Outline: This document is not a study guide, instead, it is a sheet that lists the topics covered in the Exam and at a high level highlights what to expect in the Exam?

It is highly recommended that each student makes their own study guide to incorporate bullet points to help prepare for the exam based on your class notes, slides, coding exercises, and textbook. A customized study guide preparation will help a learner to become better. Schedule office hours to go over any topics and/or clarify questions from class discussions with the Professor. 

All topics covered till end of class time on Thursday, 03/2/2023 will be included in the Exam. The topics covered and reading assignment in the exam are provided below:

Reading Assignment: Sedgewick chapter 1 and 2 

1) Algorithm to find least, most played song, diurnal range problem, aquarium problem, and average expense tracker problem. Expect to analyze variation(s) of these algorithm(s) to identify the correct output. 

2) Review algorithm design principles and formal definition(s) of asymptotic analysis (big oh, omega, and theta notations). 

Review and understand to solve all the different asymptotic analysis examples that we have learned so far. Review and understand the defective coin problem (both brute force and divide and conquer algorithm). 

3) Review Stack ADT, base operations, supporting operations, and axioms. Review the efficient and in-efficient solutions to the the Stock Span problem. Solve the Time Series (Stock Span problem) using Stack, and review the asymptotic runtime for this solution. Review lab-3 work to sort using Stack. Try out problems similar to the solution for problems covered in class activities. 

4) Review Queue ADT, base operations, supporting opera- tions, and axioms, Review the Josephus problem, Hot Potato problem. Solve the Josephus and Hot Potato problems using Queue and review the asymptotic runtime for this solution. Review the sorting problem and understand how such a problem is connected to the list data structure, and understand how such a sorting problem is solved using the Insertion sort algorithm. Analysis of Insertion sort.

5) Review how the sorting problem is solved using the Quicksort algorithm. Review both the quick sort main and partition procedure and review the analysis of Quicksort.
It is very important to go over and practice all the exercise problems discussed in class. 

6) Review how the sorting problem is solved using the Merge sort algorithm. Review both the merge sort main and merge procedure and review the analysis of Mergesort.
It is very important to go over and practice all the exercise problems discussed in class. 

7) Review the Tree basic terminologies, tree traversals, and the properties of trees. Traversals preorder, inorder and postorder. This topic will be only covered in the Exam based on how much we get to cover this week by end of Thursday's class period. 
Expect (10 to 15)% of questions from this new topic covered during this week classes!

Note: Please read the textbook, based on the reading assignment given at the end of every lecture slide. Make sure you review the questions provided in the previous quizzes. You may expect questions in the exam to be similar to the quizzes. 

Unlike the previous quizzes, Midterm is expected to cover more content, more questions, and more time will be provided. 
Typically, the questions are expected to be combination of multiple choice and narrative questions. You can expect between 10 to 20 questions and you will have the full lab time to complete the Exam. You will not receive your grade for the exam immediately after completing the google form. The results will be notified typically after a week. You are allowed to use a one-page (can be 2-sided) resource sheet during the Exam to add helpful notes and allowed to use a calculator during the Exam.
