## CMPSC 202 Spring 2023: Quiz 04 Preparatory Sheet

Date/Time: Tuesday, 04/25/2023 [during class time]

Outline: This document is not a study guide, instead, it is a sheet that lists the topics covered in the Quiz and at a high level highlights what to expect in the Quiz?

It is highly recommended that each student makes their own study guide to incorporate bullet points to help prepare for the quiz based on your class notes, slides, coding exercises, and textbook. A customized study guide preparation will help a learner to become better. Schedule office hours to go over any topics and/or clarify questions from class discussions with the Professor. 

All topics covered till end of class time on Thursday, 04/20/2023 will be included in the Quiz. The topics covered and reading assignment in the quiz are provided below:

Reading Assignment: Sedgewick  Chapter 3 (3.3), Chapter 4 (4.1,4.2,4.4)

1) Review Graph data structure. How is a graph different from Trees? What are some basic terminologies of Graphs? How to represent Graphs using an Adjacency list and matrix? 

2) Review Graph Traversals, How to traverse a graph? how do we create the DFS table?, how does the DFS algorithm work? What supporting data structure is used to generate the DFS table? what is the time complexity of the DFS algorithm? 
how do we create the BFS table?, how does the BFS algorithm work? What supporting data structure is used to generate the DFS table? what is the time complexity of the BFS algorithm? What are the differences between DFS and BFS algorithms? 

3) Review Shortest Path Algorithms, what are the different shortest path algorithms? and how do they differ from one another? What is the main purpose of the Dijkstras algorithm? how is the Dijkstras table generated? how does the algorithm work? what is the time complexity of the algorithm?

4) What are the limitations of 2-3 trees? Review the basic rules of Red-Black Trees and the algorithmic steps. How do the rotate, insert, and delete happen in Red Black Trees? Review all the examples and tryouts. 

Note: Please read the textbook, based on the reading assignment given at the end of every lecture slide. 

Typically, the questions are expected to be multiple choice. You can expect between 10 and 15 questions and you will have the full class time to complete the Quiz. You will receive your grade for the quiz immediately after finishing the quiz through google form. You are allowed to use a one-page (can be 2-sided) resource sheet during the Quiz to add helpful notes and allowed to use a calculator during the Quiz.
