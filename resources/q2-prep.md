## CMPSC 202 Spring 2023: Quiz 02 Preparatory Sheet

Date/Time: Friday, 02/24/2023 [during lab time]

Outline: This document is not a study guide, instead, it is a sheet that lists the topics covered in the Quiz and at a high level highlights what to expect in the Quiz?

It is highly recommended that each student makes their own study guide to incorporate bullet points to help prepare for the quiz based on your class notes, slides, coding exercises, and textbook. A customized study guide preparation will help a learner to become better. Schedule office hours to go over any topics and/or clarify questions from class discussions with the Professor. 

All topics covered till end of class time on Thursday, 02/23/2023 will be included in the Quiz. The topics covered and reading assignment in the quiz are provided below:

Reading Assignment: Sedgewick chapter 2 (2.1 to 2.3)

1) Review the efficient and in-efficient solutions to the the Stock Span problem. Solve the Time Series (Stock Span problem) using Stack, and review the asymptotic runtime for this solution. Review lab-3 work to sort using Stack. Try out problems similar to the solution for problems covered in class activities. 

2) Review Queue ADT, base operations, supporting opera- tions, and axioms, Review the Josephus problem, Hot Potato problem. Solve the Josephus and Hot Potato problems using Queue and review the asymptotic runtime for this solution. Review the sorting problem and understand how such a problem is connected to the list data structure, and understand how such a sorting problem is solved using the Insertion sort algorithm. Analysis of Insertion sort.

3) Review how the sorting problem is solved using the Quicksort algorithm. Review both the quick sort main and partition procedure and review the analysis of Quicksort.
It is very important to go over and practice all the exercise problems discussed in class. 

4) Review how the sorting problem is solved using the Merge sort algorithm. Review both the merge sort main and merge procedure and review the analysis of Mergesort.
It is very important to go over and practice all the exercise problems discussed in class. This topic will be covered in the Quiz only based on how much we get to cover this week by end of Thursday's class period. 

Note: Please read the textbook, based on the reading assignment given at the end of every lecture slide. 
Unlike the previous quiz, Quiz-2 is expected to cover more content, more questions, and more time will be provided. 
Typically, the questions are expected to be multiple choice. You can expect between 10 to 15 questions and you will have the full lab time to complete the Quiz. You will receive your grade for the quiz immediately after finishing the quiz through google form. You are allowed to use a one-page (can be 2-sided) resource sheet during the Quiz to add helpful notes and allowed to use a calculator during the Quiz.
