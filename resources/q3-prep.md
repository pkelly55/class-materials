## CMPSC 202 Spring 2023: Quiz 03 Preparatory Sheet

Date/Time: Tuesday, 04/04/2023 [during class time]

Outline: This document is not a study guide, instead, it is a sheet that lists the topics covered in the Quiz and at a high level highlights what to expect in the Quiz?

It is highly recommended that each student makes their own study guide to incorporate bullet points to help prepare for the quiz based on your class notes, slides, coding exercises, and textbook. A customized study guide preparation will help a learner to become better. Schedule office hours to go over any topics and/or clarify questions from class discussions with the Professor. 

All topics covered till end of class time on Thursday, 03/30/2023 will be included in the Quiz. The topics covered and reading assignment in the quiz are provided below:

Reading Assignment: Sedgewick chapter 2 (2.4), chapter 3 (3.1-3.3), chapter 4 (4.1-4.2)

1) Review Tree Data structure operations such as the traversal implementation both (iterative and recursive), tree implementation using object oriented programming, extracting parent, grand parent, child, grand child, ancestors, descendents, and lowest common ancestors. Review remote class activities from Week 9 and Lab-6. Try out problems similar to the solution for problems covered in class activities. 

2) Review Heapify process for both Max and Min heap. What is a Heap and how is it similar or different to Binary trees? Is heap complete or incomplete binary tree or both? Review Heap sort algorithm both the procedure and asymptotic time complexity. Review class activities from Week 10 and Lab-6. Try out problems similar to the solution for problems covered in class activities. 

3) Review BST (Binary Search Tree). What is a BST and is BST = Heap? Is BST complete or incomplete binary tree or both? Review BST insert, search, and delete procedures and the respective asymptotic time complexity. Review class activities from Week 10 and Lab-6. Try out problems similar to the solution for problems covered in class activities. 

4) Review 2-3 Tree. What is a 2-3 tree and why is it used? How is this different from BST. Does it address any limitation of BST?  Review 2-3 trees insert, search, and delete procedures and the respective asymptotic time complexity. Review class activities from Week 11 and Lab-7. Try out problems similar to the solution for problems covered in class activities. 

5) Review Graph data structure. How is a graph different from Trees? What are some basic terminologies of Graphs? How to represent Graphs using Adjacency list and matrix? How to traverse Graph? using depth first and breadth first traversal techniques? This topic is covered based on the coverage on Thursday 03/30/2023 class time. 

Note: Please read the textbook, based on the reading assignment given at the end of every lecture slide. 

Typically, the questions are expected to be multiple choice. You can expect between 10 and 15 questions and you will have the full class time to complete the Quiz. You will receive your grade for the quiz immediately after finishing the quiz through google form. You are allowed to use a one-page (can be 2-sided) resource sheet during the Quiz to add helpful notes and allowed to use a calculator during the Quiz.
